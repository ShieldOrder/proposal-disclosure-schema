**Proposal Disclosure Schema
**
A voluntary disclosure framework for reducing ambiguity in grant proposals.

What This Is

A text based disclosure template that helps applicants make their reasoning explicit before evaluation begins.

It does not:

Evaluate proposals

Assign scores

Imply approval

Replace human judgment

It only structures where reasoning is disclosed, not what conclusions should be drawn.

Status

v0.1

Using the Template

The disclosure template is available here:
https://shieldorder.github.io/proposal-disclosure-schema/template.html

Use of this template is optional.
Using it does not influence approval, rejection, or evaluation outcomes.

Design Principles

Voluntary, not mandatory

Text first, not automated

Discloses reasoning, does not judge it

Preserves evaluator discretion

Makes ambiguity visible without penalizing it
