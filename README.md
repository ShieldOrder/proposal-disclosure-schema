# Proposal Disclosure Schema (PDS)

Opt-in disclosure templates to make grant proposals and evaluations more legible and comparable over time.

Posture: descriptive, mechanism-neutral, non-prescriptive, non-authoritative. See docs/POSTURE.md.

## Purpose

PDS helps applicants and evaluators surface assumptions, constraints, risks, dependencies, and verification surfaces using a consistent structure.

It is intended to:
- reduce ambiguity
- improve comparability across proposals
- make verification expectations explicit
- support continuity across committee turnover

PDS does not claim endorsement, delegation, or institutional standing.

## Two Templates

- Minimal Template (adoption-first)
  - 10 questions
  - designed for low friction

- Full Template (depth-first)
  - comprehensive disclosure surface
  - intended for complex or high-risk proposals

## How to Use

Applicants:
- Start with templates/minimal.md.
- Use templates/full.md when the work has material risk, complex milestones, custody surfaces, or high budget.

Evaluators:
- Use the same structure to request clarifications.
- Treat disclosure as information, not a scoring system.

## What This Is Not

PDS is not:
- a mandate or compliance requirement
- a scoring or ranking framework
- an audit, enforcement, or governance mechanism
- legal, security, or regulatory advice
