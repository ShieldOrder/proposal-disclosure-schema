# Proposal Disclosure Schema

A voluntary disclosure framework for reducing ambiguity in grant proposals.

## What This Is

A text-based disclosure template that helps applicants make their reasoning explicit before evaluation begins.

It does not:
- Evaluate proposals
- Assign scores
- Imply approval
- Replace human judgment

It only structures where reasoning is disclosed, not what conclusions should be drawn.

## Status

v0.1 

## Using the Template

See [template.md](./template.md) for the disclosure schema.

Use of this template is optional.  
Using it does not influence approval, rejection, or evaluation outcomes.

## Design Principles

- Voluntary, not mandatory
- Text-first, not automated
- Discloses reasoning, does not judge it
- Preserves evaluator discretion
- Makes ambiguity visible without penalizing it
