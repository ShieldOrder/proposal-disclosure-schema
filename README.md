# Proposal Disclosure Schema

A voluntary disclosure framework for reducing ambiguity in grant proposals.

## What This Is

A text based disclosure template that helps applicants make their reasoning explicit before evaluation begins.

It does not:
- evaluate proposals
- assign scores
- imply approval
- replace human judgment

It only structures where reasoning is disclosed. It does not prescribe conclusions.

## Status

v0.1

## Using the Template

Disclosure template (copy and paste into your own document):

Use of this template is optional.
Using it does not influence approval, rejection, or evaluation outcomes.

Applicants typically copy the template, paste it into their own document, and answer the sections there.

## Design Principles

- voluntary
- text first
- non automated
- reasoning disclosure only
- evaluator discretion preserved
- ambiguity made visible without penalty
