Proposal Disclosure Schema

A voluntary disclosure template for reducing ambiguity in grant proposals.  

What This Is

A text-based template that helps applicants write down assumptions, scope boundaries, and verification criteria before evaluation begins.  
This template emerged from repeatedly encountering unclear scope, assumptions, and failure modes in grant proposals.


The goal is clarity, not advocacy.

What This Is Not

This template is limited to disclosure.
Evaluation remains outside its scope.
Scoring remains outside its scope.
Approval remains outside its scope.

Judgment remains with human evaluators.

Status

v0.1

This is an initial public release.
The template is intentionally minimal and text based.

Using the Template

Copy the template into your own proposal document and fill it out there.

Use of this template is optional.
Using it does not influence approval or rejection outcomes.

Design Principles

- voluntary
- text-first
- non-automated
- reasoning disclosed, conclusions untouched
- evaluator discretion preserved
- ambiguity surfaced without penalty

Authorship

This repository is a process artifact.
Its value should be judged by whether it improves proposal clarity in practice.
