# Proposal Disclosure Schema

A voluntary disclosure framework.
For reducing ambiguity in grant proposals.

## What This Is

A text based disclosure template.
It helps applicants make their reasoning explicit.
This happens before evaluation begins.

It does not:
- Evaluate proposals
- Assign scores
- Imply approval
- Replace human judgment

It only structures where reasoning is disclosed.
It does not prescribe conclusions.

## Status

v0.1

## Using the Template

The disclosure template is here:
https://shieldorder.github.io/proposal-disclosure-schema/Template.md

Use of this template is optional.
Using it does not influence approval outcomes.
Using it does not influence rejection outcomes.
Using it does not influence evaluation outcomes.

## Design Principles

- Voluntary
- Text first
- Non automated
- Reasoning disclosure only
- Evaluator discretion preserved
- Ambiguity made visible without penalty
