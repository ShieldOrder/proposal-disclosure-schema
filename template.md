ZCG Process Legibility Baseline v0.1
Derived from the Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)

Preamble and Scope

Purpose

This document describes how Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) decisions and grant execution typically operate in practice, and where discretion, verification, and implicit trust assumptions appear along that flow.

It is written to support continuity and legibility for future committee members, applicants seeking operational clarity, and observers who want a concrete map of decision and execution surfaces.

What this is

This document maps the end-to-end ZCG decision and execution process as it exists today. It separates governance mechanisms, process execution, and custody interfaces, and identifies where signals are objective, judgment-based, or implicit. It is intended as a continuity artifact to reduce institutional memory loss across committee turnover.

What this is not

This document is not a governance proposal, mandate, scoring system, or evaluation of individuals, motives, or past decisions. It is not a security audit and does not assert the presence of defects or failures.

Relationship to the Process Layer Doctrine

The Process Layer Doctrine defines execution hygiene for governance systems by treating process as infrastructure. This baseline applies the PLD lens descriptively by decomposing the ZCG workflow into stages, separating discretion from verification at each stage, and making implicit assumptions visible without prescribing change.

The PLD five tests (Impact, Clarity, Alignment, Deliverability, Verification) are referenced later strictly as an observational overlay.

Neutrality and non-prescriptive stance

This document is mechanism-neutral. It is intended to remain applicable under committee-based discretion, ZCAP-style processes, and hybrid or future governance mechanisms. Its objective is legibility, not redesign.

Versioning and change control

Version 0.1 is intentionally limited to descriptive mapping. Any future versions that introduce recommendations must be explicitly labeled as non-binding and maintained separately from the baseline.
