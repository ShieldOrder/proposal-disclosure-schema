# Contributing

This repository provides opt-in disclosure templates.

Contributions are welcome if they:
- improve clarity and legibility
- reduce ambiguity for applicants and evaluators
- preserve opt-in, non-prescriptive posture
- keep the minimal template low friction

Contributions are not welcome if they:
- introduce mandates, enforcement language, or implied compliance
- imply institutional endorsement or authority
- convert disclosure into a scoring system

For meaningful template changes:
- open an issue first
- propose exact text replacements
- update CHANGELOG.md and bump VERSION
