# Example Disclosure
Coinholder-Directed Retroactive Grants – Feedback Legibility
Illustrative Only

This is an illustrative disclosure exploring one narrow question:
How rejected applicants in coinholder-directed retroactive grants might receive usable feedback without requiring voter explanations or altering voting mechanics.

This is not a proposal.
This is not an evaluation.
This is not a governance mandate.

Proposal Title: Coinholder-Directed Retroactive Grants – Feedback Legibility
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

============================================================

CONTEXT

Observed gap:

Coinholder voting outcomes and audits are transparent.
Aggregate results are visible.
Individual voter reasoning is not.

As a result, rejected applicants have limited signal about:
- why support was insufficient
- which dimensions may have mattered
- what could realistically be improved

This contributes to repeated misalignment and proposal churn.

============================================================

IMPACT

Who is expected to benefit from this work, and how?

Primary beneficiaries are future applicants.
They may gain directional signal about proposal rejection patterns.

Secondary beneficiaries may include:
- coinholders, through reduced low-signal resubmissions
- administrators, through lower process friction
- the ecosystem, through improved proposal alignment over time

What existing baseline does this improve upon?

The baseline is a binary outcome with auditability but minimal learning signal.
This adds post-round legibility without modifying voting mechanics.

From the proposer’s perspective, what would success look like after approximately 6 months?

A post-round summary exists that:
- aggregates common approval signals
- aggregates common rejection signals
- avoids attribution to individual voters

Applicants are able to reference this when iterating.

From the proposer’s perspective, what would success look like after approximately 12 months?

Applicants converge more quickly toward viable proposals.
Repeated rejections decrease.
Coinholder voting behavior remains unchanged.

============================================================

CLARITY

What concrete outputs or deliverables are expected?

- A post-round feedback summary template
- A neutral set of signal categories
- Guidance on aggregation thresholds
- A publication cadence aligned with voting rounds

Non-goals.
What this explicitly does not attempt to do.

- Individual voter explanations
- Mandatory comment requirements
- Scoring systems
- Proposal ranking beyond vote outcomes

Key assumptions this work depends on.

- Coinholders prefer anonymity
- Aggregate signals provide sufficient learning value
- Administrative overhead must remain low

External dependencies outside the proposer’s direct control.

- Willingness of administrators to publish summaries
- Sufficient participation to generate signal
- Community tolerance for abstraction over precision

============================================================

ALIGNMENT

Which values, goals, or priorities this work is intended to serve.

- Coinholder autonomy
- Privacy of voter intent
- Reduced governance friction
- Learning without coercion

Tradeoffs being made.
What is optimized for.
What is accepted as out of scope.

Optimize for:
- aggregated signal
- low overhead
- neutrality

Accept:
- loss of granular explanation
- imperfect feedback
- delayed clarity

How this work relates to existing systems within the Zcash ecosystem.

It complements existing transparency and auditability.
It does not replace or interfere with coinholder voting.
It operates strictly after outcomes are finalized.

============================================================

DELIVERABILITY

Team capacity and availability.

Minimal administrative effort.
Primarily synthesis and publication.

Indicative timeline or phases.

- Draft summary schema
- Trial application to one completed round
- Community review
- Iterate or discontinue

Known risks or failure modes.

- Feedback too vague to be useful
- Misinterpretation as voter intent
- Increased expectations for explanation

Potential responses or mitigations.

- Reduce scope
- Increase abstraction
- Discontinue publication

============================================================

VERIFICATION

What artifacts are expected to be produced that could allow others to observe progress or outcomes?

- Published post-round summaries
- Archived prior versions
- Community feedback threads

Acceptance criteria.
How outcomes might be assessed.

Applicants report improved understanding of rejection, as observed through feedback or follow-up discussion.
Administrators report no added friction.
Voting mechanics and behavior remain unchanged.

Stop or pause signals.

- Pressure to reveal individual voter reasoning
- Perceived coercion of coinholders
- Net increase in governance friction

============================================================
