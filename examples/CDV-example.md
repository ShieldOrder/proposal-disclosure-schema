# Example Disclosure
Coinholder-Directed Retroactive Grants (Illustrative)
Applied to Feedback Gap Raised by TS
Illustrative Only

This is an illustrative disclosure exploring one narrow question:
How rejected applicants in coinholder-directed retroactive grants might receive usable feedback without requiring voter explanations or altering voting mechanics.

This is not a proposal.
This is not an evaluation.
This is not a governance mandate.

Proposal Title: Coinholder-Directed Retroactive Grants – Feedback Legibility
Applicant: N/A
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

============================================================

CONTEXT

Observed gap:

Coinholder voting outcomes and audits are transparent.
Aggregate results are visible.
Individual voter reasoning is not.

As a result, rejected applicants have little signal about:
- why support was insufficient
- what dimensions mattered most
- what could realistically be improved

This leads to repeated misalignment and proposal churn.

============================================================

IMPACT

Who benefits from this, and how?

Primary beneficiaries are future applicants.
They gain directional signal on why proposals did not pass.

Secondary beneficiaries include:
- coinholders, through reduced low-signal resubmissions
- administrators, through lower process friction
- the ecosystem, through better-aligned future proposals

What baseline does this improve on?

The baseline is a binary outcome with auditability but no learning signal.
This adds post-round legibility without changing vote mechanics.

What does success look like at 6 months?

A post-round summary exists that:
- aggregates common approval signals
- aggregates common rejection signals
- avoids attribution to individual voters

Applicants can reference this when iterating.

What does success look like at 12 months?

Applicants converge faster toward viable proposals.
Repeated rejections decrease.
Coinholder voting remains unchanged.

============================================================

CLARITY

What concrete deliverables will you produce?

- A post-round feedback summary template
- A standard set of neutral signal categories
- Guidance on aggregation thresholds
- A publication cadence aligned with voting rounds

Non-goals.
What this intentionally does not attempt.

- Individual voter explanations
- Mandatory comment requirements
- Scoring systems
- Proposal ranking beyond vote outcomes

Key assumptions this work depends on.

- Coinholders prefer anonymity
- Aggregate signals are sufficient for learning
- Administrative overhead must remain low

External dependencies outside your control.

- Willingness of administrators to publish summaries
- Sufficient participation to generate signal
- Community tolerance for abstraction over precision

============================================================

ALIGNMENT

Which values or priorities this serves.

- Coinholder autonomy
- Privacy of voter intent
- Reduced governance friction
- Learning without coercion

Tradeoffs you are making.
What you optimize for.
What you accept as out of scope.

Optimize for:
- aggregated signal
- low overhead
- neutrality

Accept:
- loss of granular explanation
- imperfect feedback
- delayed clarity

How this fits within the Zcash ecosystem.

It complements existing transparency and auditability.
It does not replace or interfere with coinholder voting.
It operates strictly after outcomes are finalized.

============================================================

DELIVERABILITY

Team capacity.
Realistic hours per week.

Minimal administrative effort.
Primarily synthesis and publication.

Timeline with milestones.

- Draft summary schema
- Trial application to one completed round
- Community review
- Iterate or abandon

Known failure modes.
What could realistically go wrong.

- Feedback too vague to be useful
- Misinterpretation as voter intent
- Increased expectations for explanation

Contingency plans if those failures occur.

- Reduce scope
- Increase abstraction
- Discontinue publication

============================================================

VERIFICATION

Artifacts you expect to produce as evidence of progress.

- Published post-round summaries
- Archived prior versions
- Community feedback threads

Acceptance criteria.
How success will be determined.

Applicants report improved understanding of rejection.
Administrators report no added friction.
Voting behavior remains unchanged.

Stop conditions.
Signals that this should halt.

- Pressure to reveal voter reasoning
- Perceived coercion of coinholders
- Net increase in governance friction

============================================================
